## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Email Service Not Working
- Check SMTP credentials in `.env`
- Verify email service configuration
- Test with Gmail app passwords

#### 2. File Upload Errors
- Ensure upload directories exist
- Check file size limits
- Verify file permissions

#### 3. Reminder Service Not Running
- Check cron job configuration
- Verify timezone settings
- Monitor service logs

#### 4. Database Performance
- Ensure indexes are created
- Monitor query performance
- Check connection limits

### Health Check

Run system health check:

```javascript
import YearlyBookingSystemInitializer from './src/scripts/initializeYearlyBookingSystem.js';

const initializer = new YearlyBookingSystemInitializer();
const status = await initializer.getSystemStatus();
console.log(status);
```

## Security Considerations

- **File validation**: All uploads are validated for type and size
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Admin endpoints restricted to admin users
- **Data sanitization**: All inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Rate limiting**: Consider implementing for file uploads

## Performance Optimization

- **Database indexes**: Optimized for common queries
- **File storage**: Organized directory structure
- **Caching**: Consider Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Background jobs**: Reminders run asynchronously

## Future Enhancements

- **SMS notifications** for critical reminders
- **Bulk payment processing** for multiple months
- **Payment plan customization** (bi-weekly, quarterly)
- **Integration with payment gateways** for direct payments
- **Advanced analytics** with charts and graphs
