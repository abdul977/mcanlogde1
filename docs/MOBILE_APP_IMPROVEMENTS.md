```

### Payment System Flow
```
Order Creation → Payment Upload → Admin Verification → Order Confirmation
     ↓               ↓                ↓                    ↓
  Bank Details    Screenshot      Approve/Reject      Status Update
  Provided        Upload          Decision            & Notification
```

### Price Calculation Pipeline
```
Cart Items → Item Totals → Subtotal → Shipping → Tax → Final Total
    ↓            ↓           ↓          ↓         ↓        ↓
Validation → Formatting → Breakdown → Display → Sync → Checkout
