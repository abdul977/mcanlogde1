## How Everything Connects

### Data Flow (Simplified)
1. **User visits website/app** ‚Üí Frontend loads
2. **User performs action** (login, book, shop) ‚Üí Frontend sends request to Backend
3. **Backend processes request** ‚Üí Checks database, validates data
4. **Backend sends response** ‚Üí Frontend updates display
5. **Real-time updates** ‚Üí Socket.io pushes live updates to all connected users

### Example: Booking Process
1. User browses accommodations on frontend
2. Frontend requests accommodation list from backend API
3. Backend queries MongoDB database for accommodations
4. User selects accommodation and submits booking
5. Backend creates booking record in database
6. Admin gets notification via real-time messaging
7. Admin reviews and approves/rejects booking
8. User gets notification of approval status
9. User uploads payment proof
10. Admin verifies payment and updates status
