# MCAN Server-Side Integration Status

## 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Authentication Token Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** The JWT token was created with `{ id: user._id }` but controllers were looking for `req.user._id`

**Root Cause:**
- Login controller: `JWT.sign({ id: user._id }, ...)`
- Booking/Message controllers: `const userId = req.user._id`
- Mismatch between `id` and `_id` properties

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated all controllers to handle both formats: `const userId = req.user._id || req.user.id`
- Files updated:
  - `server/src/controller/Booking.js` (6 instances)
  - `server/src/controller/Message.js` (6 instances)

### 2. **Frontend Authentication Header** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** BookingConfirmation component was getting token from localStorage instead of auth context

**Solution Applied:**
- Added token validation before API calls
- Maintained consistency with other components
- Added proper error handling for missing tokens

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling** ✅ ADDED
**Problem:** Limited debugging information for authentication issues

**Solution Applied:**
- Added comprehensive logging in booking controller
- Added user ID validation before processing
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging

- `lectures` - Lecture programs
- `events` - Event programs
- `bookings` - Booking requests and status
- `messages` - User-admin communications

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Backend Integration Test Results
```
✅ Database connection: Working
✅ Model definitions: Working
✅ Booking system: Ready
✅ Messaging system: Ready
✅ User authentication: Ready
```

### API Endpoint Status
- **Authentication**: ✅ Working
- **Booking Creation**: ✅ Fixed (token mismatch resolved)
- **Booking Management**: ✅ Working
- **Message System**: ✅ Working
- **Admin Functions**: ✅ Working

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Secure token verification
- Role-based access control

### Authorization
- User-only endpoints for personal data
- Admin-only endpoints for management
- Proper user ownership validation

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- MongoDB injection prevention
- Required field validation

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Environment Variables Required
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Server Dependencies
All required packages are installed:
- express
- mongoose
- jsonwebtoken
- bcryptjs
- cors
- dotenv

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient aggregation pipelines
- Proper relationship modeling

### API Optimization
- Pagination for large datasets
- Selective field population
- Efficient query patterns

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- Consistent API response format
- Proper error handling
- Authentication token management

### Database Relationships
- User → Bookings (one-to-many)
- User → Messages (one-to-many)
- Accommodation → Bookings (one-to-many)
- Program → Bookings (one-to-many)
